<h1>Settings<a class="headerlink" href="#settings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Much of Kluster is automated, and I try to minimize the amount of setup options available to the user through the graphical interface.  I do this intentionally (not just because I am lazy) because I think the potential users of Kluster are a diverse audience that want a streamlined processing system.  Something that isn’t overwhelming, with toolbars and settings dialogs.</p>
<p>In this section, I’ll be discussing the settings available to configure in Kluster.  Note that all settings are saved to the kluster ini file (\HSTB\kluster\misc\kluster.ini) so that when the program reopens, the settings are repopulated.  Project related settings are also saved to the project file (kluster_project.json) and set on loading a new project file.</p>
<div class="section" id="general-settings">
<h2>General Settings<a class="headerlink" href="#general-settings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>General settings are accessed through the “File - Settings” menu.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_images/settings_1.png"><img alt="../_images/settings_1.png" src="../_images/settings_1.png" /></a>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Enable Parallel Writes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although this should not be the case, I have seen occasional issues with how Kluster writes to disk in parallel.  There should no longer be issues with PermissionsErrors and writes to disk, but if you were to see this again, disabling the parallel writes would most likely eliminate those.  It will also slow down the Kluster performance, so keep this checked if you can</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Retain Waterline Changes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Only used when you are using the Kluster vessel file.  With a vessel file loaded, when you add new multibeam data it will use the most recent entry in the vessel file for the offsets/angles/tpu parameters.  The vessel file will override the offsets/angles in the multibeam data.  This includes the waterline value, which is the one setting that might change
across days of data that you want to keep.  If you want to retain the waterline changes in new multibeam data, keep this checked.  Otherwise, waterline changes will not be saved to the vessel file.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Force all days to have the same Coordinate System</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This one is useful if you are using the Auto UTM option in project settings.  Sometimes you will have multibeam files in a project that span across multiple UTM zones.  If this is the case and this option is unchecked, each day of data will determine the best UTM zone to use in processing.  Check this option to force all added multibeam data to use the same UTM zone or EPSG code as the first processed day of data in the project.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Process Mode</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Controls what kind of processing actions will appear within Kluster.  See the following auto mode explanations for the currently available options:</p>
<p>NORMAL = Data is converted and processed as it comes in, where each line added would reprocess the whole day.  This is how Kluster generally operates.  You add 10 lines, it converts 10 lines and then generates a processing action to process 10 lines all the way through TPU calculation.</p>
<p>CONVERT ONLY = Data will only convert.  This can be useful if you want to process later.  Or if you just want access to the raw data for some reason</p>
<p>CONCATENATE = Data will convert as normal but processing actions will occur on a line by line basis and only if that line has not been processed.  This one is a bit more complicated.  If you were monitoring a directory as the sonar was running, you would get a new line, wait 10 minutes, get a new line, etc.  In normal mode, Kluster would convert one line and then fully process that line, and then convert the next line and fully process both lines.  In normal mode, full days get processed at a time.  In this mode, Kluster will convert and process line by line to save time when you are adding files every now and then.</p>
<p>WARNING: This mode will need to be changed back to normal mode if you want to use the processing actions generated as you change settings (i.e. changing vertical reference).  If you leave Kluster in concatenate mode, it will be satisfied with data that has been fully processed already regardless of settings.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>VDatum directory</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Only used when you are using the ‘NOAA MLLW’ or ‘NOAA MHW’ options under vertical reference in Project Settings.  These two options require VDatum to perform the vertical transformation from ellipse to MLLW/MHW.  With VDatum provided, you are able to process using these two vertical references natively in Kluster, without the need for a separate gridded transformation file.</p>

<h2>Layer Settings<a class="headerlink" href="#layer-settings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Layer settings are accessed through the “View - Layer Settings” menu.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_images/settings_2.png"><img alt="../_images/settings_2.png" src="../_images/settings_2.png" /></a>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Background Layer</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The layer to show behind the multibeam lines and surface.  The Default option uses the shapefiles found in (\HSTB\kluster\background) and does not require internet.  You can actually replace these files if you like with the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/shorelines/">higher resolution options</a>.  I don’t, as mine are quicker to load and pan around, and I’m after performance in the default layer.  The Vdatum layer requires a Vdatum path in General Settings to a local instance of Vdatum.  All other layers require internet and a successful QGIS initialization.  If you find the other layers do not initialize correctly and you have internet, there must be an issue with the QGIS initialization.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Background Transparency</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Percent transparency to apply to the background layer(s)</p>

<h2>Project Settings<a class="headerlink" href="#project-settings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Coordinate System</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Coordinate System is used during georeferencing to project the sound velocity corrected offsets to northing/easting/depth values.  Altering the Coordinate System will produce a new georeference/TPU action.  The Coordinate System specified here will apply to all currently loaded days of data.</p>
<p>From EPSG will use an integer EPSG code to determine the coordinate system of this project.  See the currently available codes <a class="reference external" href="https://epsg.org/home.html">here</a>  Note that the coordinate system provide must be a projected coordinate system with units in meters/feet.</p>
<p>Auto UTM is the primary way to set the coordinate system for a project.  This will use the provided coordinate system and the longitude of the provided data to automatically determine the appropriate UTM zone.  It will do this for each day, unless you use the Settings - Force all days to have the same Coordinate System option.  If that option is set and you are using Auto UTM, it will use the UTM zone of the first loaded day of data.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Vertical Reference</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Vertical Reference used during georeferencing to go from reference point relative depths to the specified reference.  Altering the Vertical Reference will produce a new georeference/TPU action.  The Vertical Reference specified here will apply to all currently loaded days of data.</p>
<p>Waterline - sound velocity corrected offsets (relative to reference point) + heave - waterline</p>
<p>Ellipse - sound velocity corrected offsets (relative to reference point) - altitude</p>
<p>NOAA MLLW - sound velocity corrected offsets (relative to reference point) - altitude - MLLW Separation from VDatum</p>
<p>NOAA MHW - sound velocity corrected offsets (relative to reference point) - altitude - MHW Separation from VDatum</p>
